## Problem Statement ‚ö†Ô∏è

KYC are really long and boring to do, and you have to do it everytime you register to a new plateform.

## Solution üìú

We created KlickYC, which allows you to linked your ENS and your bank account to your KYC. So you just have to do the KYC the 1st time, and everytime you would like to do another KYC, you enter your ENS and connect your bank account to proof you already did the KYC.

## Features ‚ú®

We use ENS as an on-chain identity to allows us to do the link with a bank account. Once the user have done the KYC, the ENS will be linked forever to the bank account. This way, everytime the user will have to do a KYC, he will just need to select his ENS and to connect his bank account to do his  KYC.  
We used LightHouse to store our data on IPFS very easily. Using the sdk of LightHouse, we are able to store a file in an IPFS url and then to get the data from it.
